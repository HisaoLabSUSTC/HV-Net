MATLAB implementation of hypervolume approximation methods in polar coordinate system
	
These programs are based on our paper[1]. Please refer to it for more details.
Following are function list:
	
1. HyperVol.m: approximate hypervolume;
	- Input: point set (a matrix containing $n$ rows of $m$-d vectors, same below), 
		reference point (a row vector, same below), sample number,
		and the algorithm (a string containing the name of the algorithm [method], same below);
	- Output: approximated volumes.
2. HyperCon.m: approximate hypervolume contribution;
	- Input: point set, reference point, sample number, and the algorithm name;
	- Output: approximated volumes.
3. Ihk.m: approximate the I^h_k indicator proposed in HypE[2]. 
	- Input: point set, reference point, the hypervolume parameter $k$, sample number, 
     		and the algorithm name;
	- Output: approximated volumes.
	
where [method] is one of following methods:
1. "Polar": hypervolume approximation methods in polar coordinate system (Approximation method 1
			in our paper)
2. "Direct-Norm": hypervolume approximation methods in direction space where uniformly distributed 
			points are generated by the unit normal vector approach 
			(Approximation method 2-1 in our paper)
3. "Direct-NT": hypervolume approximation methods in direction space where uniformly distributed 
			points are generated by the inverse cumulative distribution function approach 
			(Approximation method 2-2 in our paper)
			
			
Before the use, all cpp files need to be compiled by mex. We have prepared make.m for compilation:
